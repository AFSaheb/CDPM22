Survey Data Analysis 

The goal of this project was to analyze the satisfaction levels of attendees at our career day event. We designed a survey and collected responses from ~300 attendees, and then used RStudio to analyze the data and create visualizations.

We conducted various analyses such as calculating the mean and standard deviation of the satisfaction ratings and creating frequency distributions of the responses to each question.

We investigated, among other things, the satisfaction rate for each talk from alumni as well as for talks and meetings with the sponsors. For the visualizations of the data we used charts, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and histograms. We used ggplot2 to create customized plots that allowed us to easily compare the satisfaction ratings of for example different sessions.

In conclusion, analyzing the survey results and visualizing them with allowed us to gain valuable insights into the satisfaction levels of the attendees and communicate those insights effectively to our sponsors, DKFZ Career Service as well as following organization team. We hope that this project will help us to improve our future career day events and continue to make a positive impact on Phd students, postdoc and other attendees of following Career Days.
